Throughout the manual you will find references in italics, these are 
instructions to help you use the manuals features. The bold, italic YourCompany

ATTN: ISO 9002 companies, if your company is not design responsible (does
not design its own products/services) you need to remove section 4.4, Design
Control as it does not apply to you. By leaving this in your manual you
will be expected to comply with the Design Control elements of ISO 9001 and
your registrar and customers will be very confused.
